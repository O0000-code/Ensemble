## Core Concepts

These are the primary modules you will work with inside Ensemble. Each section links to its detailed description in the [Usage Guide](./usage.md).

| Concept | Description | Link |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Skills** | Claude Code skill modules (markdown files that give Claude specialized capabilities). Managed in `~/.ensemble/skills/` with global or project-level scope. | [Usage Guide -- Skills](./usage.md#skills) |
| **MCP Servers** | Model Context Protocol servers that extend Claude Code with additional tools and data sources. Configurations stored in `~/.ensemble/mcps/`. | [Usage Guide -- MCP Servers](./usage.md#mcp-servers) |
| **Scenes** | Configuration bundles that combine multiple Skills, MCP Servers, and CLAUDE.md files into reusable templates. | [Usage Guide -- Scenes](./usage.md#scenes) |
| **Projects** | Link Scenes to local project directories so configurations can be deployed with one click. | [Usage Guide -- Projects](./usage.md#projects) |
| **CLAUDE.md** | Context files that provide instructions to Claude Code at the global or project level. | [Usage Guide -- CLAUDE.md](./usage.md#claudemd) |

## Additional Features

| Feature | Description | Link |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **AI Auto-Classification** | Use the Claude CLI to automatically categorize, tag, and assign icons to Skills, MCPs, and CLAUDE.md files. | [Usage Guide -- Auto-Classification](./usage.md#auto-classification) |
| **Finder Integration** | Install a Quick Action to open project folders with Claude Code directly from Finder's right-click menu. | [Usage Guide -- Finder Integration](./usage.md#finder-integration-macos) |
| **Terminal Support** | Choose your preferred terminal (Terminal.app, iTerm2, Warp, or Alacritty) for launching Claude Code sessions. | [Usage Guide -- Terminal Support](./usage.md#terminal-support) |
| **Trash & Recovery** | Deleted items are moved to trash and can be restored from Settings. | [Usage Guide -- Trash & Recovery](./usage.md#trash-and-recovery) |
