```
Every MCP you install in Claude Code eats your context.

Every. Single. Session.

50 MCPs? That's 50x the context waste.

I just open-sourced something that fixes this forever.

Introducing Ensemble.

Thread
```

### Tweet 2/7 - 278 chars
```
The problem is REAL:

Claude Code loads ALL your MCPs/Skills in EVERY session.

Working on a Python project? It still loads your Docker, Kubernetes, and 20 other tools.

That's precious context gone before you even start coding.

This drove me crazy. So I built Ensemble.
```

### Tweet 3/7 - 271 chars
```
Ensemble is a unified config manager for Claude Code.

Finally manage:
- Skills
- MCP Servers
- CLAUDE.md

All in ONE native macOS app.

No more JSON editing.
No more terminal commands.
No more config chaos.

Just a beautiful UI for everything.
```

### Tweet 4/7 - 268 chars
```
The killer feature? SCENES.

Create different configurations for different projects:

- "Python Dev" scene: just Python MCPs
- "DevOps" scene: Docker + K8s only
- "Writing" scene: minimal tools

Switch in ONE CLICK.

Your context stays clean. Your Claude stays fast.
```

### Tweet 5/7 - 276 chars
```
But wait, there's more:

- Finder integration (right-click any folder)
- AI-powered skill categorization
- Global CLAUDE.md management
- Project-based config sync
- Beautiful native macOS design

Built with Tauri 2.0 + React + Rust for speed.

No Electron bloat here.
```

## Thread Version B - Objective/Technical Style

### Target Tone
Factual, informative, focused on functionality. Let the product speak for itself.

### Tweet 1/7 (Hook) - 274 chars
```
Claude Code loads all installed MCPs and Skills in every session, consuming context even when unused.

This architectural decision has a real cost for power users.

I built Ensemble to solve this with scene-based configuration management.

Here's how it works:
```

### Tweet 2/7 - 269 chars
```
The context consumption problem:

Each MCP/Skill in Claude Code adds to your context budget.

With 30+ tools installed, a significant portion of your context is consumed before any actual work begins.

Ensemble provides selective loading through configurable scenes.
```

### Tweet 3/7 - 275 chars
```
What Ensemble manages:

1. Skills - Scan, categorize, tag with AI assistance
2. MCP Servers - Configure and discover tools
3. CLAUDE.md - Global settings with project distribution

All three configuration types in one unified interface.

Native macOS app, no terminal required.
```

### Tweet 4/7 - 263 chars
```
Core feature: Scenes

A Scene is a predefined configuration set.

Example configurations:
- Frontend Dev: Browser, Design MCPs only
- Backend Dev: Database, API MCPs only
- Documentation: Minimal tools

Each scene activates only relevant tools for the task.
```

### Tweet 5/7 - 271 chars
```
Project integration:

- Associate projects with specific scenes
- Right-click any folder in Finder to apply
- Sync configurations across workspaces
- CLAUDE.md management per project or global

Designed for developers managing multiple project contexts.
```

### Tweet 6/7 - 258 chars
```
Technical details:

- Built with Tauri 2.0 (Rust backend)
- React frontend
- Native macOS integration
- Local-only, no cloud required
- MIT licensed, fully open source

Repository includes full documentation and contribution guidelines.
```

### Tweet 7/7 (CTA) - 247 chars
```
Ensemble is available now on GitHub.

If you use Claude Code with multiple MCPs, this might help your workflow.

Feedback and contributions welcome. Issues and PRs are open.

## Thread Version C - Humble/Personal Style

### Target Tone
Personal story, seeking feedback, community-oriented. Build connection through authenticity.

### Tweet 1/7 (Hook) - 276 chars
```
I've been using Claude Code daily for 6 months.

One thing kept bugging me: I had 40+ MCPs installed, and Claude loaded ALL of them every time.

So I spent my weekends building a small tool to manage this.

Today I'm sharing it. Would love your feedback.
```

### Tweet 2/7 - 273 chars
```
My problem was simple:

I work on different types of projects - Python backends, React frontends, DevOps scripts.

Each needs different tools. But Claude Code doesn't let you pick and choose.

I wanted something like "profiles" but for Claude Code configs.
```

### Tweet 3/7 - 267 chars
```
So I built Ensemble.

It's a macOS app that lets you manage:
- Skills
- MCP Servers
- CLAUDE.md files

Nothing fancy, just a GUI instead of editing JSON files manually.

I'm not a designer, so please forgive the UI. Function over form for now.
```

### Tweet 4/7 - 262 chars
```
The feature I use most: Scenes

It's basically config presets.

I have "Python Mode" with just my Python tools.
"Writing Mode" with minimal distractions.
"Full Power" with everything when needed.

Switching takes one click. Saves me context and mental load.
```

### Tweet 5/7 - 269 chars
```
Some other things it does:

- Scans your installed skills automatically
- Lets you tag and categorize them
- Right-click integration in Finder
- Manage CLAUDE.md globally or per-project

Built with Tauri because I wanted it fast and small. No Electron here.
```

### Tweet 6/7 - 261 chars
```
I've been using it myself for a month now.

It's stable enough for daily use, but definitely has rough edges.

I'm open-sourcing it (MIT) because:
1. Maybe others have this same problem
2. I'd love help making it better
3. Why not share useful things?
```

### Tweet 7/7 (CTA) - 258 chars
```
If you use Claude Code and want to try it:

Link in bio.

If you find bugs (you will), please open an issue.
If you have ideas, I'm all ears.
If it helps you, that makes my day.
